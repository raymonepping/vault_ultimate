# vult-tf-seal: Terraform root vault-seal on vault-s (D7). Declared, plannable
# structure only: the Transit mount and key, the autounseal policy, the token
# role, the audit device. It may NOT mint a seal token from the role: issuing
# tokens is an act with a moment, and that is Ansible's job (seal-tokens).
# Written once by Ansible (seal-init) with the init root token; nothing can
# widen it afterwards except a user-run make root-regen CLUSTER=seal.
